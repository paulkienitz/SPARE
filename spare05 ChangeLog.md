# SPARE Change Log

### Release 5 — __ __ __

1. API changed to use promises instead of callbacks, making it incompatible with release 3.  The main methods, `replaceContent` and `simulateNavigation`, now return a Promise object, and in case of failure now reject that Promise with an Error object instead of throwing that Error as an exception.

2. Parameters `callbackContextData`, `onSuccess`, and `onFailure` removed from the two main methods, as are their corresponding global default properties.

3. The deprecated parameter `transitionalContentID` is removed from `replaceContent`, along with its corresponding global default property.

4. The `timeout` parameter no longer supports being polymorphically passed in an earlier position.  (The `timeout` property is now the only remaining global default; using that may be preferable.)

5. The methods `supportLevel` and `canSimulateNavigation` are removed.  SPARE simply initializes its global object to null if a required API, such as Promise, is missing.  Test that for null to activate any fallback script code.

6. Internet Explorer 11 still has some support, though it requires a polyfill to supply the Promise object.  No other old browsers are supported anymore — no testing is done with them.

7. The first parameter of the main methods has been renamed from `elementID` to `target`.  It can now be either a string containing an ID, or an HTMLElement object.

8. * * * fixed onPopStateRestore


### Release 4 - ? ??, 2022

1. Refactored the code to reduce repetition and bring the architecture closer to what will work in the future Promise-based version.

2. As part of refactoring, renamed input parameters `elementID` as `target`, `pageURL` as `contentURL`, and `newElementID` as `contentElementID`.

3. Added a feature to `simulateNavigation` and `onPopStateRestore` so they can simulate the `DOMContentLoaded` event.  This is activated by setting the new global property `SPARE.simulateDCL` to true.  If false it instead fires a new event called `SPAREContentLoaded`.

3. Improved `onPopStateRestore` to better handle returns to initially loaded pages, so that it can just replace the updated element with original content instead of reloading the whole page.  Added a safety check to it for cases where the history has somehow gotten out of sync.  (This may not be necessary.)  Gave `onPopStateRestore` a return value of `true` when it replaces content.  But clarified that `onPopStateRestore` is not yet ready for handling cases where multiple targets are updated, and it can’t be expected to correctly restore such documents.  The prior flaws in `onPopStateRestore` are the whole reason why I did an additional release of the old API.

4. Updated the `state` object saved in browser history to use new renamed properties consistent with parameter naming elsewhere: `targetID` instead of `oldId`, `contentURL` instead of `url`, `contentElementID` instead of `newId`, `newTitle` instead of `title`, and `pretendURL` instead of `showURL`.  However, the poorly chosen old names are also still present for compatibility, until we transition to the new Promise-based API.  Also, `newTitle` and `pretendURL` are now present unconditionally, instead of only when returning to an originally loaded page.

5. Because HTTP 2 no longer includes a text description with its response status, such as "Not Found" for 404, SPARE 4 now substitutes a generic text such as "HTTP status 404" if none was received.

6. Changed the license from Apache to modified BSD.  My change is mainly to clarify the right to minify the script.

### Release 3 - June 12, 2021

1. Added `pretendURL` parameter to `simulateNavigation`, so that the URL shown in the address bar can differ from the one that content is loaded from.  In popstate handlers, the state object now has a `showURL` property which stores this value.

2. When a popstate handler is returned to the page from which `simulateNavigation` was first called, it now receives a different state object with properties `startURL` and `startTitle`.  (In release 2, state would be null in this case, and the page content would probably fail to restore.)  The default handler `onPopStateRestore` now reloads the page from `startURL`.

3. Dropped support for the `transitionalContentID` feature.  The parameter and property are still present for API compatibility, but are now ignored.  (The API of SPARE 5 will be incompatible.)

4. Dropped support for IE 8 and 9, and any browser version older than about 2011.  This further simplifies the implementation by removing fallback code paths.  There are no longer any browsers where `supportLevel` is nonzero but `canSimulateNavigation` is false.

5. It now accepts HTTP result codes of 201 and 203 as well as 200.

### Release 2 - October 16, 2019

1. Support for Internet Explorer 7 (which was very limited) dropped completely, and with it, the return value of 1 from `supportLevel`.

2. Unified the XHR code paths so that only text mode is used, which turned out to make SPARE a lot faster.  Removed the return value of 3 from `supportLevel`.

3. Deprecated, but did not remove, the `transitionalContentID` parameter of the `replaceContent` method.  The API remains compatible with SPARE 1.

4. Added new API entry points `simulateNavigation` and `canSimulateNavigation`, and available event handler `onPopStateRestore`.

5. Added support for `FormData` and `URLSearchParams` objects being passed as `postData`, where release 1 only supported strings.

6. We now support `timeout` values between 0.0 and 1.0; in the first release, 1.0 seconds was the minimum allowed.

7. Supported polymorphic use of `timeout` in any optional parameter position, as long as the final parameter is a number.

8. Importing of downloaded HTML into document redone with better performance and fewer code paths.  This avoids a problem in release 1 where IE 9, 10, and 11 would, when asked to load a full HTML document, use content from the head as well as the body.  But *note* that though this problem is cured in IE 10 and 11, I cannot guarantee it is always mitigated in IE 9, particularly if the document you download has bad syntax.  (A future release will drop support for IE 8 and 9.)

### Release 1 - March 24, 2015

1. Created API entry points `replaceContent` and `supportLevel`.  A value of 1 returned by `supportLevel` indicates that only some functions work.

2. `XMLHttpRequest` (XHR) is used with two code paths, one using its text mode and the other using its XML/HTML mode.  The latter path is indicated by a return value of 3 from `SupportLevel`.
